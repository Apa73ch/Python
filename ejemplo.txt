The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a
specific element is contained in the set. This is based on a data structure known as a hash table. Since sets are unordered,
we cannot access items using indexes as we do in lists.

Python set is an unordered datatype, which means we cannot know in which order the elements of the set are stored.
Python sets cannot have a duplicate value and once it is created we cannot change its value.
The first code explains that the set cannot have a duplicate value. Every item in it is a unique value.
